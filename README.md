# Weather Data Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing weather data to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies. By leveraging Python and powerful data visualization libraries, it presents insights into various weather conditions and their implications.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaning and structuring raw weather data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Identifying trends in temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
  - Seasonal and regional analysis.
  - Highlighting anomalies and significant weather events.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Time series plots for temperature and rainfall.
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
  - Distribution plots for various weather metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas 
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook file (`Weather data analysis.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Usage
- Ensure the input dataset is in the required format.
- Load the dataset into the notebook.
- Execute the analysis cells and review the outputs for insights.

## Outputs
- **Key Insights**:
  - Trends in temperature and precipitation.
  - Analysis of seasonal variations.
  - Visualizations for weather conditions.

## Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load raw weather datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and format data.
3. **Analysis**: Execute EDA and identify patterns.
4. **Visualization**: Generate graphs and plots for better understanding.
